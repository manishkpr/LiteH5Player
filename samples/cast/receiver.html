This sample demonstrates how to build your own Receiver for use with Google
Cast.

A receiver is typically an HTML5 application with a html, css, and JavaScript
components.

In this HTML5 page, we include our style sheet, the Receiver SDK, and our player
JavaScript code.

We Then define two layers within the player:

1. The media layers
2. The Overlay layers
The overlay layer holds:
   a. Logo for startup page
   b. Media Artwork and information during loading
   c. controls for Pause / Seek
